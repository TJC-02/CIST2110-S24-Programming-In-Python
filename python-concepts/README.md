# Python Concepts Showcase

A growing collection of Tyler's basic Python programs, demonstrating fundamental programming concepts through small, runnable examples.

## Programs

| Program | Description | Concepts demonstrated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Grade Calculator](grade_calculator_python.py) | Converts a numeric percentage into a letter grade using the program's custom grading scale. | Variables, strings, f-strings, input/output, float conversion, rounding, comparisons, and if/elif conditionals. |

## Run a program

Install Python 3, then run this command from the repository root:

```bash
python python-concepts/grade_calculator_python.py
```

Use `python3` if that is your Python command. No third-party packages are required.

Enter a percentage such as `96.25` (meaning 96.25%, rather than 0.9625).

## Add more programs

1. Add a new `.py` file to this folder using a descriptive filename such as `loops_example.py`.
2. Add a row to the table above describing its purpose and the concepts it demonstrates.
3. Run the program and commit the file and README update.

Future examples could explore loops, functions, lists, dictionaries, file handling, and exceptions.

## Grade calculator development notes

The calculator is preserved as originally uploaded. Its current conditional chain does not assign a grade when the rounded input is from 68 through 72.99, causing a `NameError`. The intended grade for that interval needs to be defined in a future revision. Non-numeric input also raises an error, and percentages outside 0–100 are not rejected.
